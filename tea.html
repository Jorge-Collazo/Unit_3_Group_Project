    <h2>Tea Flavor:</h2>
    <p>
        A traditional flavor that's beloved to just about all people everywhere. From being a simple morning beverage to 
        a sweet drink that's consumed at different parts every day, it can be said that tea is drank everywhere. For such a 
        drink not to recieve a twist and allow for further convenience, us at N-ice Dude wish to bring our solution to you!
    </p>

    <h2>History of the Flavor:</h2>
    <p>
        Do you hate putting ice in your tea, only to have the ice melt and water down your drink? We assumed so, 
        so that’s why us at N-ice Dude developed the tea ice, so when you put your ice tea in your iced tea, you 
        won’t have to worry about your flavor being diminished if you wait a while to drink it. The sheer convenience 
        of it allowed the tea flavor to quickly rise up the ranks and secure the top spot out of our flavors.
