    <h2>What are N-ice Dude's Ice Cubes and how do they work?</h2>
    <p>
        Here at N-ice Dude, we make it our aim to always be revolutionizing even the most 
        simple of objects. Our latest business entry, our Ice Cubes, filled with all-natural 
        flavors that will completely change your drink after dropping a couple of cubes into it.
        Currently, at N-ice Dude we have a selection of ten exuberant flavors, but don't worry, if 
        a flavor you want isn't available, know that we are constantly in development of new flavors 
        and you will be able to vote on our social media pages for a chance to get your flavor featured!
